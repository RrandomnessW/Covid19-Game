# Covid19-Game
## Introduction
This project is a game made in java to bring awareness to the epidemic that has impacted society. The game is a top down racing game where you play as a jogger that must avoid the hazards of the world that could give you Covid19. The game features two difficulty options and many different death screens and victory screens. Additionally, the game includes some instructions on how to play the game. The main reason for this projects creation was to create a game surrounding the subject of Covid19 for my grade 12 AP Computer Science final assignment and to practice making executable jar files.
